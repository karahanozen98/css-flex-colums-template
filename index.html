            <h3 class="colum-header">Technology</h3>
            <p> Etymologically the term technology comes from the combination of these two Greek morphemes tékhnē,
                (meaning “art”) and ‎-logía (meaning “study”). It refers to the collection of techniques, skills,
                methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or the accomplishment of
                objectives,
                such as scientific investigation.</p>

        <div class="column-50">
            <h3 class="colum-header">Human Species</h3>
            <p> The human species' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple
                tools.
                The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Agricultural Revolution increased the
                available sources of food. Likewise, the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and
                control
                their environment. Later developments in historic times, including the printing press, the
                telephone,
                and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact
                freely
                on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing
                destructive power.</p>

            <h3 class="colum-header-dark">Subject</h3>
            <p> Technology has been a subject of discussion in philosophy since the Greeks. The Greek philosopher
                Democritus, for example, believed that technology is an imitation of nature. House-building and
                weaving
                were first invented by imitating swallows and spiders building their nests and nets, respectively.
                Aristotle held the same view that technology is the consequence of imitation of nature, but he added
                in
                his book Physics Book II that:</p>

            <h3 class="colum-header">Grid Layouts </h3>
            <p> Grid layouts are the bread and butter of web development design and chances are you've reached for
                something
                like Bootstrap or Foundation to make your layouts a reality. But, like most of you, I don't have a
                fondness
                of the dependencies required to run Bootstrap or Foundation nor do I like the ding to my page load
                times.</p>

            <p> In fact when I use Bootstrap for an application that I am writing, I really almost only ever use it for
                the
                grid layouts, sometimes I will use it for notifications or basic fairly sensible CSS defaults, but 90%
                of
                the time, all I want is the grid layouts.</p>

            <p>I also don't appreciate only have options of splitting columns into 12 columns or less. It feels like you
                sometimes have to do some crazy work arounds to get columns in columns, or strange things like that.</p>

            <p> How can we do grid layouts faster and easier? Flexbox is your answer. I think
                Grid layouts are the bread and butter of web development design and chances are you've reached for
                something
                like Bootstrap or Foundation to make your layouts a reality. But, like most of you, I don't have a

            <h3 class="colum-header-dark">Flexbox</h3>
            <p> At this point flexbox is pretty much everywhere. It's supported by all major browsers. It allows for
                much
                easier layouts and is supported by React-Native which means when I layout pages for React-Native I reach
                for
                flexbox first, but I have found my self reaching for flexbox first in web development as well.

                In fact the last application I laid out, I did entirely with flexbox. I have found it that easy to use.

                If you don't know too much about flex box. I like this page that gives a good run down of flexbox</p>
